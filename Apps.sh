# Linux

#    Download Visual Studio Code for Linux
#    Make a new folder and extract VSCode-linux-x64.zip inside that folder
#    Double click on Code to run Visual Studio Code

#    Tip: If you want to run VS Code from the terminal, create the following link substituting /path/to/vscode/Code with the absolute path to the Code executable

# sudo ln -s /path/to/vscode/Code /usr/local/bin/code
sudo ln -s /home/decisactor/Documents/VSCode-linux-x64/Code /usr/local/bin/code
# Now, you can simply type code . in any folder to start editing files in that folder.
